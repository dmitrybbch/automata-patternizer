# automata-patternizer
Takes image files and converts them to an array of 0-255 numbers that represent each pixel's greyscale color.
First line is the default rule for opening with the cellular automaton.
The files are made to be opened by the java cellular automaton that is in another repo. The folder is a Netbeans project.




Run in console. By default takes the image named image.jpg and converts it into "finished.txt", with rule 23/3 (Game of Life).

DISCONTINUED

This was intended to create patterns out of images to use along with the cellular automaton in its own repo, but the automata can now open images directly.
